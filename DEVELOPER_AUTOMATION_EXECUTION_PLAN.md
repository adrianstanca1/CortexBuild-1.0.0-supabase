**Exit Criteria**
- Sign-off memo referencing PRD.
- Compliance backlog created in Jira with owners/dates.

## Phase 1 – Workspace Provisioning Foundations (Weeks 2-6)
**Objectives**

- Provide CLI + API for lifecycle operations.

**Milestones**
1. **Infrastructure Setup (Week 2-3)**
   - Provision dev K8s cluster + namespaces per tenant.
   - Configure Vault/SOPS for secrets injection.
   - Implement service account & RBAC policy.
2. **Workspace Service MVP (Week 3-4)**
   - API: `POST /workspaces`, `POST /workspaces/{id}/actions`.
   - Templates stored via declarative YAML.
   - Status tracking + resource tagging.
3. **CLI & Console Integration (Week 4-5)**
   - `cortex dev workspace create/resume/hibernate`.
   - Integrate status cards & actions into ConstructionAutomationStudio.
4. **Observability & Guardrails (Week 5-6)**
   - Metrics (provisioning time, active sessions).
   - Quota enforcement + idle hibernation.

**Deliverables**
- Workspace service (Go/Node) with unit tests.
- CLI package (npm) + docs.
- UI integration (cards, actions, console logs).
- Runbook for provisioning failures.

## Phase 2 – Automation Runtime & Canvas v1 (Weeks 6-12)
**Objectives**
- Launch a workflow engine supporting triggers/actions, simulation, deployments.
- Embed canvas in Developer Console.

**Milestones**
1. **Runtime Core (Week 6-8)**
   - Temporal/Zeebe or BullMQ-based orchestrator.
   - Trigger ingestion (webhook, Procore event bus, timers).
   - Action execution workers with sandboxing.
2. **Canvas & Authoring (Week 8-10)**
   - XYFlow + Monaco integration.
   - Node palette (trigger, transform, action).
   - Versioning (save, publish, rollback) + JSON schema.
3. **Simulation & Logs (Week 10-11)**
   - Sandbox data injection.
   - Step-by-step logs with timings & payloads.
   - Manual run & dry-run endpoints.
4. **AI Assist Beta (Week 11-12)**
   - Suggest next node + code snippet via Gemini.
   - Review/approve flow to prevent unsafe actions.

**Deliverables**
- Runtime service with integration tests.
- Canvas React components integrated into ConstructionAutomationStudio.
- API docs & Postman collection.
- Observability dashboards & alerting (failed runs, latency).

## Phase 3 – Marketplace Manifest & Submission (Weeks 12-18)
**Objectives**
- Formalize package structure and submission pipeline.
- Build reviewer console, install/uninstall flow.

**Milestones**
1. **Manifest Schema (Week 12-13)**
   - JSON schema for `.cortexapp` (metadata, permissions, connectors, pricing).
   - Validation tooling (CLI + CI hook).
2. **Submission Flow (Week 13-15)**
   - UI wizard (define metadata, upload assets, attach manifest).
   - Automated checks (schema validation, lint, security scan).
   - Reviewer dashboard with status management.
3. **Install/Uninstall & Billing Hooks (Week 15-17)**
   - Tenant install endpoint (scopes, secret provisioning).
   - Uninstall cleanup.
   - Stripe subscription or usage-based billing integration.
4. **GTM Readiness (Week 17-18)**
   - Docs, sample packages, marketing assets.
   - Internal enablement training.

**Deliverables**
- Manifest schema + docs.
- Marketplace submission UI.
- Reviewer tooling & audit trail.
- Billing + entitlement integration.

## Phase 4 – Connectors & Templates (Weeks 18-24)
**Objectives**
- Ship prioritized connectors & ready-made automation templates.

**Milestones**
1. **Tier-0 Connector GA (Week 18-20)**
   - Procore RFIs/Submittals/Daily Logs/Budget/Observations.
   - Validate against real sandbox data & usage quotas.
2. **Tier-1 Connector Beta (Week 20-22)**

   - Beta program with designated partners.
3. **Automation Templates (Week 22-24)**
   - Safety Escalation, Submittal Fastlane, Closeout Ops.
   - Documentation, quickstart videos.
4. **Field Feedback Loop (Week 24)**
   - Collect pilot metrics, iterate on connectors/templates.

**Deliverables**
- Connector SDK packages + docs.
- Certified connector listings in marketplace.
- Template library accessible in Automation Studio.
- Feedback report for continuous improvements.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Security:** Regular pen tests, secret rotation automation, RBAC enforcement.
- **Compliance:** Audit logging, data retention policies, SOC2 evidence collection.
- **Observability:** Unified dashboards (workspace health, runtime success, marketplace installs).
- **Change Management:** Feature flags per tenant, staged rollouts, rollback procedures.

## Reporting & Cadence
- Weekly program sync (Engineering + Product + Compliance).
- Bi-weekly stakeholder update with status, risks, decisions.
- Monthly executive review (progress vs roadmap, financial impact).

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Circulate PRD & this plan for approval (Product Lead).
2. Spin up Jira epics for Phase 1 workstreams; assign leads.
3. Prepare infrastructure request for workspace cluster & Vault integration.
4. Draft manifest schema proposal; schedule review with Marketplace team.
5. Start connector discovery with Procore & Autodesk partner contacts.
